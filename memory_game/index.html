		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>

		<!-- <p>Train your brain! While there is some research that matching games can improve cognitive ability, it's a quick way to have fun and relieve stress. Make the game harder if it's too easy or try and improve your best time!</p> -->
